/// Jetleaf REST sub-library
///
/// This sub-library defines the **REST client abstraction** of the
/// `jetleaf_web` package.
///
/// Importing `package:jetleaf_web/rest.dart` exposes APIs for building,
/// executing, and intercepting REST requests, along with request and
/// response representations and execution infrastructure.
///
/// This library is intended for outbound HTTP communication and does
/// not include server-side request handling concerns.
